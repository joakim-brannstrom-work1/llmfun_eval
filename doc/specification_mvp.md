# LLM Evaluation Framework — MVP Specification

## BorderAgent: Simplified Evaluation Framework

This document defines a minimal viable product (MVP) for evaluating the BorderAgent LLM system. The goal is to get a working evaluation framework quickly, then expand as needed.

---

## 1. What We're Evaluating

The BorderAgent LLM is a **multimodal** system that:
- Uses built-in vision to analyze images from border surveillance cameras
- Receives CNN classification probabilities as supplementary data to enhance strategic decision-making
- Must decide on an appropriate action from a set of tools following a 5-level escalation protocol

### How llmfun Accesses Images

The llmfun agent uses the `loadImageApi` tool to read images from its workarea. During evaluation:
1. Test images are copied to `llmfun/workarea/`
2. The prompt instructs the agent to use `loadImageApi` to analyze the image from a specific path
3. The agent analyzes both the visual content AND CNN probabilities to make strategic decisions

### 1.1 Evaluation Dimensions

| Dimension | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Threat Detection** | Correctly identify threats from image + CNN data |
| **Tool Selection** | Choose the right tool(s) for the situation |
| **Escalation Compliance** | Follow the 5-level escalation ladder correctly |

### 1.2 The Escalation Protocol

```
Level 1: Visible warning    → trackerLight
Level 2: Audible warning    → audibleWarning
Level 3: Visual strobe      → strobeLight
Level 4: Human operator     → humanOperator
Level 5: Call for patrol    → callPatrol
```

## 2. Test Dataset

### 2.1 Dataset Structure

Each test case is a JSON record:

```json
{
  "id": "test_001",
  "category": "no_threat",
  "image_path": "images/border_patrol/clear_001.jpg",
  "prompt": "Analyze this image from a border surveillance camera. Use loadImageApi to analyze the image from path 'images/border_patrol/clear_001.jpg'.",
  "cnn_probabilities": {
    "person": 0.02,
    "vehicle": 0.01,
    "animal": 0.05,
    "background": 0.92
  },
  "ground_truth": {
    "threat_level": "none",
    "expected_tools": [],
    "expected_escalation_level": 0
  },
  "metadata": {
    "description": "Clear background, no entities of interest"
  }
}
```

**Note:** The `image_path` field specifies where the test image is located. During evaluation:
- Images are copied to `llmfun/workarea/` so the agent can access them
- The `prompt` should include instructions to use `loadImageApi` with the image path
- This enables testing the multimodal capability of the LLM (vision + CNN probabilities)

### 2.2 Initial Test Categories

For the MVP, we start with 5 categories and 25-30 test cases:

| Category | Description | Count |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| `no_threat` | Clear background, no entities | 5 |
| `single_low_threat` | Single person, non-threatening | 5 |
| `single_high_threat` | Person with hostile indicators | 5 |
| `animal_false_positive` | Animals (not threats) | 5 |
| `persistent_threat` | Threat persisting over time | 5-10 |

## 3. Scoring Engine

### 3.1 Core Metrics (MVP)

We use **3 basic metrics** that are commonly used in LLM evaluations:

#### Metric 1: Tool Selection Accuracy

Did the LLM select the correct tool(s)?

```
Exact Match:        LLM tools == expected tools → 1.0
Subset Match:       expected ⊆ LLM tools → 0.7  (over-escalation)
Superset Match:     LLM tools ⊆ expected → 0.5  (under-escalation)
Partial Overlap:    |intersection| / |union| → 0.0-0.5
No Overlap:         → 0.0
```

#### Metric 2: Escalation Level Accuracy

Is the escalation level correct?

```
Exact Match:        level_diff == 0 → 1.0
Off by 1:           level_diff == 1 → 0.7
Off by 2:           level_diff == 2 → 0.4
Off by 3+:          level_diff >= 3 → 0.0
```

#### Metric 3: Threat Detection (TP/TN/FP/FN)

Binary classification: threat or no threat?

```
TP: Threat present, LLM detected → 1.0
TN: No threat, LLM did nothing   → 1.0
FP: No threat, LLM escalated     → -2.0 (penalty)
FN: Threat present, LLM missed   → -3.0 (penalty)
```

### 3.2 Composite Score

```
composite_score = (
  0.40 * tool_selection_accuracy +
  0.30 * escalation_level_accuracy +
  0.30 * threat_detection_score
)
```

Weights can be adjusted based on operational priorities.

### 3.3 Pass/Fail Criteria

```
Pass: Composite score ≥ 0.70
Fail: Any high-threat case missed (FN)
```

## 4. Evaluation Pipeline

### 4.1 Simple Flow

```
┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
│ Test Loader │───▶│  Evaluator  │───▶│   Scoring   │───▶│    Report   │
│ (JSON file) │    │ (call LLM)  │    │  (compute)  │    │  (JSON)     │
└─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘
```

### 4.2 Pipeline Steps

1. **Load Test Dataset** - Read JSON file with test cases
2. **For each test case:**
   - **Copy image to workarea**: Copy `image_path` to `llmfun/workarea/` so the agent can access it
   - **Build prompt**: Include instruction to use `loadImageApi` with the image path + CNN probabilities
   - **Call llmfun agent**: The multimodal LLM analyzes the image AND uses CNN probabilities
   - **Parse response**: Extract tools called from agent output
   - **Calculate scores**: Compare against ground truth
3. **Aggregate Results** - Compute composite score
4. **Generate Report** - Output JSON with results

**Example Prompt Construction:**
```
Analyze this image from a border surveillance camera. 
Use loadImageApi to analyze the image from path 'images/border_patrol/clear_001.jpg'.

CNN Classification Probabilities:
- person: 2.00%
- vehicle: 1.00%
- animal: 5.00%
- background: 92.00%

Based on your analysis, determine the appropriate action(s) using your available tools.
```

### 4.3 Tool Call Extraction from History

Instead of parsing raw LLM output with regex, we extract tool calls directly from the saved chat history JSON file. This is more reliable and matches how the agent actually stores its interactions.

#### History JSON Structure

The history is saved as a JSON file containing messages:

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {"role": "system", "content": "..."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "..."},
    {"role": "tool", "name": "toolName", "content": "...", "tool_call_id": "..."},
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "tool_calls": [
        {
          "id": "chatcmpl-tool-xxx",
          "type": "function",
          "function": {
            "name": "trackerLight",
            "arguments": "{\"param\": \"value\"}"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Extraction Process

1. Load the history JSON file
2. Find all messages with `role: "assistant"` that contain `tool_calls`
3. Extract `tool_calls[].function.name` for each tool call
4. Map tool names to escalation levels

```
History JSON → Extract tool_calls → {
  "tools_called": ["trackerLight", ...],
  "escalation_level": inferred_from_tools,
  "reasoning": "string"
}
```

## 6. Future Development

This section outlines how to expand the framework once the MVP is working.

### Phase 1: Enhanced Testing

- [ ] **Adversarial test cases** - Weather (fog, rain, night), occlusion, low-resolution images, CNN probability conflicts
- [ ] **Temporal sequences** - Multi-step scenarios showing threat evolution over time
- [ ] **Larger dataset** - Expand to 100+ test cases across more categories
- [ ] **Vehicle category** - Add vehicle detection tests

### Phase 2: Advanced Metrics

- [ ] **Reasoning quality evaluation** - Use a stronger "Judge LLM" to evaluate if the LLM picked the right tool for the right reason (detects "lucky guesses")
- [ ] **Consistency scoring** - Run each test case multiple times (N=5) to measure variance
- [ ] **Latency tracking** - Measure response time; add p50/p95 targets
- [ ] **Per-category thresholds** - Different pass/fail criteria per category based on criticality

### Phase 3: Operational Features

- [ ] **Cost tracking** - Monitor token usage and API costs per run
- [ ] **Budget alerts** - Warn when approaching cost limits
- [ ] **Comparison reports** - Compare runs over time, detect regressions
- [ ] **Multiple output formats** - Add Markdown and HTML reports
- [ ] **Trend analysis** - Track score changes across dataset versions

### Phase 4: Security & Governance

- [ ] **RBAC** - Role-based access control (Admin, Evaluator, Viewer)
- [ ] **Audit logging** - Log all actions with timestamps and actors
- [ ] **Ground truth validation** - Peer review workflow for labels
- [ ] **Dataset versioning** - Track changes to test datasets
- [ ] **Prompt injection safeguards** - Protect against malicious inputs

### Additional Ideas

- [ ] **Benchmarking** - Compare multiple LLMs on same test set
- [ ] **A/B testing** - Test different prompts against each other
- [ ] **Real-time dashboard** - Live visualization of evaluation progress
- [ ] **CI/CD integration** - Run evaluations automatically on code changes
- [ ] **Regression detection** - Automatically flag score drops > 5%
- [ ] **Human feedback loop** - Allow evaluators to annotate and correct results
